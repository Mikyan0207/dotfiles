# Final Fantasy XIV - Settings & Mods

## Tools

### [FFXIV TexTools](https://www.ffxiv-textools.net/)

TexTools is a FFXIV Modding Framework for both mod creation and use/installation.<br>
Used to upgrade the game's textures.
<br><br>

### [GShade](https://gposers.com/gshade/)
Unlike others, GShade runs on a custom in-house ReShade build which features a network-unlocked Z-Depth Buffer in Final Fantasy XIV.
GShade is the only ReShade build capable of completely ignoring the Final Fantasy XIV UI, including job bars and nameplates,
meaning gameplay presets look better on GShade than on anything else.
<br><br>
Presets: **TODO**
