# Windows Terminal

Windows Terminal with Powershell v7.<br>
Starship for customization which I found faster and better than oh-my-posh.<br>
`ls` is replaced by `lsd`, a rust alternative with more options and colored output. (`exa` is not available on Windows.)<br>
`cat` is replaced by `bat`, also a rust alternative.
